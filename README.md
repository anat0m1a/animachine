# Lizzy's Animachine

_Probably highly unreliable. Use this at your own expense. lol._

On a more serious note, please use this script with the expectation 
that manual script configuration might be necessary. Due to the way 
some create .mkv files and other such containers read by mediainfo,
especially in large batches, sometimes things might go awry during 
batch processing. This script tries to anticipate a sudden change of 
subtitle track by preferring title tag first, and language second. 

Welcome to Lizzy's portable (x265/HEVC) anime encoding convenience script. 
This was created after reading Kokomin's writeup: "Anime on a Technical Level - 
Anime Encoding Guide for x265 (HEVC) & AAC/OPUS (and Why to Never Use FLAC)", which
can be found [here](https://kokomins.wordpress.com/2019/10/10/anime-encoding-guide-for-x265-and-why-to-never-use-flac/).

## Usage

``animachine`` is a simple-to-use script that currently takes no arguments
from the user. Simply run the script and it will walk you through the process 
of setting up your directories and presets for use by the script. Feel free to
customise the encoding presets used by the script to your preference!
