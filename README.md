Welcome to Lizzy's portable x265 anime encoding convenience script. 
Before running, please ensure a version of ffmpeg with x265 is
accessible in your system path. Please also ensure you have changed the
destination directory before running the script.
Additionally, this script will pass the current working directory
into ffmpeg. If you do not want it to do this, set the srcDir
variable in the script.
